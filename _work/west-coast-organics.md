When you've just had that lovely first introduction, who sticks around to remind that potential client that you exist (_Well, you probably know because you see the images right here, but aaaanyway_... )? That's right - business cards. The amount of power those 2x3.5 (or square!) pieces of paper carry is crazy! Business cards are all about leaving a lasting impression, being succinct, and letting people know you are here for them.

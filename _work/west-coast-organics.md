I worked as design assistant for the summer to Emily Wells, designer and brand educator. During that time I collaborated with her on The Build Your Brand Collection -  brand designs available for purchase. The brands are customizable with clients company name and color palette, and delivered ready for use in their business. For West Coast Organics, I created the logo and graphic elements. I wanted the visual aspects of this brand to feel fresh, minimalistic, and updated. I could see this brand being a great fit for a juice bar, citrus inspired product, or even a food blog.

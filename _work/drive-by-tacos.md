How doesn't love tacos? On this logo design project I collaborated with designer, Dawn Curtis by heading up the discovery and first draft stage of this companyâ€™s logo. A retro vibe is what this southern USA taco truck was looking for. The bright red, mustard, and black colors combined with the vintage truck, completed their simple, yet retro, branding.

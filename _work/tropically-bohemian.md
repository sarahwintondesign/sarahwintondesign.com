Where tropical and mountain vibes meet faith and worldwide adventure. Simple line art with a tropical feel was the look this travel blog needed for their branding details. My clientâ€™s goal was to create a website that would serve as a travel log, a place of purchase of urban, graphic clothing, and a home for inspirational essays. Designing with a modern and casual look, Tropically Bohemian is a place for wanderers and fashion enthusiasts.

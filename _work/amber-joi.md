I was mentored by graphic designer, Dawn Curtis. During the 10 week mentorship, I collaborated on a personal branding project for client, Amber Joi. My work on this project started with the discovery stage. During this stage, I collected inspiration, and isolated the main voice Amber wanted for her logo: edgy, modern, and professional. I then created the logo and wordmark, which was presented to our client. My mentor and I collaborating on the remainder of this project, including final revisions and delivery of the formated files.

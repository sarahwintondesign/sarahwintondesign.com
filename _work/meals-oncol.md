Amber Joi - a modern, edgy, monogram. This was created while participating in a design internship with mentor Dawn Cutis. Some of the major areas of focus that were learning during this time was implementing creative direction and learning design software. This logo is still one of my favorite, and it was when I truly started encountering my signature style - b/w, sharp edges, and simplicity.

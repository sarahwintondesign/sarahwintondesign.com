Visual identity creation. This is the process of taking raw ideas and dream, and creating a visual identity for your company. Logo, color palette, font choice, and graphic images. This is paramount for a company having a cohesive voice. Having a logo that articulates your company's values, is eye catching to your audience, and is artfully crafted are three aspects necessary for a quality logo.

The visual identity process begins with hearing the mission and key attributes of your business. Then I collect inspiration, sketch, and create a presentation for you. Three presentations will be sent, with revisions welcome after each one. Meeting deadlines and keeping good communication is very important to me. I continue to work till the project is artfully designed and meets my clients goals. Anticipate 5-7 weeks from start to finish for your newly custom designed logo to be in your hands.

Here are some examples of visual identities that have been custom designed for clients. 1 - 3) Personal logo design with an edgy, modern feel. 2 - 4) Independently owned pet shop, with a vintage look. 5 - 7) Citrus and clean lines, West Coast organics is optimal for a juice bar or even food blog. 8 - 9)   Meals OnCol is a non-profit that provides support to those undergoing cancer treatment by delivering them nutritious meals.

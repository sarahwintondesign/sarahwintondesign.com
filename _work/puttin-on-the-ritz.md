Postcards are simple, a bit more information, and a fun size to pique someones interest without overwhelm of information. Some examples below 1) Sarah Winton Design postcard for clients. 2) Pet-supply shop with a vintage feel for their southern USA location - complete with a beagle design used in branding is based off of the owner, Sarah Vanderford’s very own dog, and store’s namesake, Ritz.

    description: Graphic design is my passion. Since I was young, I've been captivated by creativity and the arts. Realizing my love for design, I participated in two mentorships. Since then, I have worked as a freelance designer. I've had the opportunity to work with clients such as non-profits, brick and mortar shops, and food trucks.

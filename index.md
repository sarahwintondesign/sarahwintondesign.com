    description: |-
      Creativity has always been a part of my life; from sketching and painting as a kid, to discovering my love for graphic design. Now as a designer I have the opportunity to work with clients to create logos, complete visual identity systems, and marketing material. My passion is to create visuals that artfully and effectively achieves my clients goals, from non-profits, to brick and mortar shops, to entrepreneurs.

      My design process begins with hearing the mission and key attributes of your business. Then I collect inspiration, sketch, and create a presentation for you. Meeting deadlines and keeping good communication is very important to me. I continue to work till the project is artfully designed and meets my clients goals.

      I would love the opportunity to hear about your design needs - let me know, and I'll schedule a FREE consultation.
